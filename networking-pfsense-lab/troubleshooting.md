# Troubleshooting

## Goal
Document network issues encountered and how they were resolved.

## Example Issues
- VM cannot ping pfSense → check interface config
- DHCP IP not assigned → verify DHCP range and LAN interface
- DNS not resolving → check pfSense DNS settings

## Screenshots
- `screenshots/troubleshooting/`
- Example: `dhcp-fix.png`, `dns-fix.png`
